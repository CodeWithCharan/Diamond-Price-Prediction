# Diamond-Price-Prediction

### Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict diamond prices based on various features such as carat, cut, color, and clarity.

### Workflow

1. **Update** `config.yaml`
   - **Purpose:** Centralizes configuration settings for the pipeline, including data paths, model parameters, and directory structures. This allows flexibility in adjusting the pipeline without hardcoding values.

2. **Update** `schema.yaml`
   - **Purpose:** Defines the structure and data types of the input dataset, ensuring that the data meets the required format for processing (e.g., column names, data types).

3. **Update** `params.yaml`
   - **Purpose:** Stores hyperparameters (e.g., `n_estimators`, `random_state`) and model-specific configurations. This makes the model easily tunable without changing the code.

4. **Update the** `entity`
   - **Purpose:** Defines data classes to manage the configuration for various pipeline stages (e.g., data ingestion, validation). This provides a clean and organized way to handle configurations across the pipeline.

5. **Update the** `configuration manager`
   - **Purpose:** Loads and manages the configurations from `config.yaml`, `schema.yaml`, and `params.yaml` and makes them available to the various components of the pipeline.

6. **Update the** `components`
   - **Purpose:** Implements individual components (e.g., data ingestion, data validation, feature transformation) for the machine learning pipeline. Each component is responsible for a specific task.

7. **Update the main** `pipeline`
   - **Purpose:** Manages the flow of the pipeline, determining the sequence of operations (data ingestion → validation → transformation → training → evaluation). It ensures that each component is executed in the right order.

8. **Update** `main.py`
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the entry point for executing the entire pipeline. It triggers each stage sequentially, enabling the end-to-end execution of the project.
